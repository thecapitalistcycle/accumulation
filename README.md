Need bib file with all above and below references (plus more later) in this repository together with all stages from OCR text and bib file to final pdf of Bing and Petersen.

Below are examples of references that should have been added directly into Zotero as should be easy to find using Zotero either by DOI or via Google Scholar.

Eventually we should be able to semi-automate rough notes like this into Zotero.
