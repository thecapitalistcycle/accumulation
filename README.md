# Accumulation

This repository is for material related to Marx's General Law of Capitalist Accumulation that will be needed for an SFC ABM model explaining Maksakovsky's "The Capitalist Cycle" that are not directly in Maksakovsky's work or related to "reproduction schemes".

# Wages

Wages are the price of the commodity labor power, regulated like any other by demand and supply, with a "natural price" or value at equilibrium.

The precondition for capitalism arising historically from earlier modes of production is that a class of workers who do not have means of subsistence or production on which to live sell their labor power to a class of capitalists who own the wealth in money, means of subsistence and means of production. This precondition reproduces itself on an expanding scale because the workers end up paid enough to live but not to accumulate and so spend what they earn and so each period begins again with a working class that has nothing to sell but its labor power and a capitalist class that owns even more wealth.

Need bib file with all above and below references (plus more later) in this repository together with all stages from OCR text and bib file to final pdf of Bing and Petersen.

Below are examples of references that should have been added directly into Zotero as should be easy to find using Zotero either by DOI or via Google Scholar.

Eventually we should be able to semi-automate rough notes like this into Zotero.

### Savings

"To put it mathematically:
the rate of accumulation is the independent, not the dependent
variable; the rate of wages is the dependent, not the independent
variable."

"Accumulate ... that is Moses and the prophets"

## Wages - Supply

Far too complex to do realistic analysis but can avoid the usual passive fodder theory and at least have a backward bending supply curve just based on cost of free disposable time that corresponds to the same biological time preferences as for capitalists with the rich having different savings and leisure "preferences" simply because "they have more money" (Great Gatsby).
